# Introduction #
The data grid is a component we developed for PDI version 3.2.0 In the meantime it has been contributed to the official PDI release (as of version 4.0). Consequently the below documentation only applies to the version we ship with KFF. As of PDI 4.0 we recommend you use the version included in the official PDI distribution.

# Details #
The data grid step will appear in the KFF directory as shown below:

The first tab in the step will allow you to define the names and data types of the fields you want to add. In other words, the definition of your little grid database.

The second tab allows you to specify the actual values for the fields you defined. You can simply enter the values in the grid as you would in an Excel file.
