#summary How to get started with KFF, running one single environment

= Introduction =
This how-to guide show how to set up a single (development) environment using KFF.

= Installation =
== Step 1 - Download and install KFF ==
Download KFF from the downloads section (, for the moment get the kff directory from svn) and place it in a directory /kff on the root of (one of) your disk(s). The final directory structure should look like [StandardsDirectory this].

In case you want to use another installation directory, that is no problem. You will have to adjust the some variables in your launch scripts: kff_spoon_launcher.sh and kff_kitchen_launcher.sh for that later on during the installation scenario.

== Step 2 - Download PDI (3.2.3, 3.2.4 or 3.2.5) and install ==
Unzip PDI into the /kff/software/pdi/3.2.3/ (for version 3.2.3).

The KFF reference build for 3.2.3 can be found over [http://kettle3.s3.amazonaws.com/pdi-ce-3.2.3-r13847.zip here].
A recent build of 3.2.5 (Sept 3rd, 2010) is placed [http://kettle3.s3.amazonaws.com/pdi-ce-3.2.5-r13847.zip here].


== Step 3 - [http://code.google.com/p/kettle-franchise/downloads/detail?name=kff-plugins.jar&can=2&q= Download the KFF plugins] ==
... and drop it into the libext directory of your PDI installation.

== Step 4 - Copy the provided template to create your own datawarehouse project ==

E.g. copy /kff/projects/templates/datawarehouse to /kff/projects/pepsi/finance-datamart/ if you are going to build the finance data mart for your precious customer Pepsi.

== Step 5 - Modify your launch scripts ==
=== kff_spoon_launcher.sh ===
Set parameters according to your liking:

{{{
# Parameters for sample data warehouse project ##################################
CUSTOMER_NAME=templates
PROJECT_NAME=datawarehouse
PROJECT_DIR=/kff/projects/$CUSTOMER_NAME/$PROJECT_NAME
PROJECT_KETTLE_VERSION_PRD=/kff/software/pdi/3.2.3

PROJECT_JAVA_VERSION_DEV=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk/jre/bin/java
}}}

=== kff_kitchen_launcher.sh ===
Set parameters according to your liking:

{{{
# Batch process (kettle job) to launch ##########################
KFF_CUSTOMER=templates ;
KFF_APPLICATION=datawarehouse ;
KFF_BATCH=batch_datawarehouse.kjb
}}}

{{{

KFF_BASE_DIR=/kff ;
KFF_LIFECYCLE=DEV ; 
KFF_PDI_VERSION=/kff/software/pdi/3.2.3 ; 
KFF_JVM_VERSION=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk/jre/bin/java ;;
}}}
