#summary kettle plug-ins

= Introduction =
This page documents the KFF plugins for kettle.

= "Install" the jar file =
All KFF plugins are available as a [http://code.google.com/p/kettle-franchise/downloads/detail?name=kff-plugins.jar&can=2&q= jar file] which you need to drop into the libext directory of your kettle installation.

= Environment variables =
In order for the plugin to work correctly in versions before PDI 4.0, you need to set two environment variables:
 * GDK_NATIVE_WINDOWS=1
 * KETTLE_PLUGIN_PACKAGES=be.kjube

In case you use the KFF start-up script you needn't worry about these variables since KFF includes it's own start-up script [kff_spoon_launcher.sh] (only for Linux right now) which set these variables.

= Plug-in's= 
The following plug-in's have been released:
 # [PluginDataGrid Data Grid]
 # [PluginEnvironmentConfigurator Environment Configurator]
