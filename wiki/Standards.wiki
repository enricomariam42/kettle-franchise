#summary Standard set-up

= Standard & set-up conventions =
This page describes the set-up and the standards that KFF proposes in order to enable rapid deployment of multiple kettle solutions.

This includes the following elements:
 * directory structure
 * variables

= Directory structure =
KFF proposes the following directory structure (all directory names lower case):

Root directory and subdirectories

{{{
* /kff               --> kff root
* /kff/projects      --> contains your ETL code
* /kff/reusable      --> contains re-usable pieces of ETL code
* /kff/software      --> contains different versions of (PDI) software
* /kff/documentation --> contains kff documentation
}}}

== Structure of project directory ==
The following standard applies to the project directory.

*Each data integration project should be included in a separate sub-folder*
Standard set-up expects a folder per customer and sub-folders per project.

{{{
* /kff/projects/customer_name/project_name/
}}}

Example
{{{
* /kff/projects/coca-cola/production_datamart/
* /kff/projects/coca-cola/purchasing_datamart/
* /kff/projects/pepsi/datawarehouse/
* /kff/projects/nike/customer_data_quality/
* /kff/projects/nike/retail_finance_eai/
}}}

*Each project directory has the following sub-directories:*

{{{
* /kff/pr.. /cfg      --> contains configuration files as kettle.properties, etc ..
* /kff/pr.. /code     --> contains your .ktr, .kjb and other code
* /kff/pr.. /data/in  --> incoming data files
* /kff/pr.. /data/out --> outgoing data files
* /kff/pr.. /ddl      --> SQL scripts and DDL
* /kff/pr.. /dmp      --> database dump files
* /kff/pr.. /tmp      --> temporary files
