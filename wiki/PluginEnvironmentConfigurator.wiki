#summary kettle plug-in - environment configurator

= Introduction =
The environment configurator allows you read a 'kettle.properties' in any location you want and override the value set in $HOME/.kettle/kettle.properties.

= Details =
The environment configurator step looks like this:

Basically there 3 ways of setting the path to .properties file you want to use.

*1) Don't fill in any of the fields*

In this mode the environment configurator is configured out of the box for KFF. It will assume that you pass the named parameters KFF_CUSTOMER, KFF_APPLICATION, KFF_LIFECYCLE to kitchen on the command line.

With those parameters the configurator will look for the .properties files on the path:

{{{
/kff/projects/$KFF_CUSTOMER/$KFF_APPLICATION/config/configuration_$KFF_LIFECYCLE.properties
}}}

Example: config files for the datawarehouse template that ships with KFF

*2) Decide yourself which will be the variable names

In this example the path to your custom .properties file will be:

{{{
/kff/projects/$MY_CUSTOMER/$MY_APPLICATION/config/configuration_$MY_LIFECYCLE.properties
}}}

*3) Set the path completely*

This gives you full control over the path and file name you want to use.

Typically you would include the KFF environment configurator as the first step in your top level job (as we've done in the KFF batch_launcher.kjb) so you are sure all variables are set before you start processing.
